Maybe the delivery drivers fault, but  it seems Kite struggle if there are more than 4 boxes to deliver. I end up having to chase after this.Date of experience: May 17, 2023"
Jasmine Maidment,3 reviews,1,GB,An hour agoVerified,"Awful experienceI was sent an email saying my delivery had been signed for and taken in by myself. I was not in at the time of delivery. My flat mate had buzzed the driver up, who then left only one of the items I delivered in the stairwell of my flat building. I was then told by customer service the rest of my delivery would be sent the next working day. It did not arrive, I have now been told to wait again. I paid a huge delivery fee needing the items asap and they still haven’t been delivered and the entire ordeal has been difficult and stressful. I would not order here again.Date of experience: May 17, 2023"

Richard Grimshaw,4 reviews,1,GB,"May 15, 2023Verified","Deplorable customer serviceWe have been a loyal customer of Kite Packaging for many years. We recently placed an order for almost £500 worth of packaging and attempted to use the discount code for £15 off on a spend of £150 which we had been sent by Kite. It would not discount for some reason online. I contacted our account Manager by email, who did not respond, and was finally contacted by someone else who told me that they would not action the discount from their end, as I had requested. I was just told to use the code next time if it was still valid. Really disappointed and cross about this poor service, we were entitled to the discount and if it would not process, then they should  action it centrally, not just wash their hands of it. The code will probably have expired by our next order. I have also tried to contact by social media and no response. What a way to treat loyal customers. I think this service is deplorable and I am looking for an alternative packaging supplier, which is a great shame after so many years. Kite Packaging - take note...Date of experience: May 08, 2023"

C Hookham,8 reviews,5,GB,"Updated May 9, 2023Verified","Good quality,  cheap bags, perfect service.The price beat everybody else...to the extent I thought it might be a mistake or the quality would be reflected......I was wrong on both counts.  Some of the seals are defective on some of the bags,  but when you order 5000,  you realistically expect some might not be to the same quality.  to put into perspective...I have used a couple of hundred bags so far and maybe 10 are faulty.  I can live with that quite happily. they arrived well packaged and within 3 days despite the bank holiday....cannot be faulted.**NOTE**  Following this review Ref Jocelyn contacted me direct to investigate this matter.  It was an investigation which I did not think needed to happen,  but they were committed to quality and Customer service and I think that deserves a mention.  This company, in my opinion,  has gone from good to GREAT.  Do not hesitate using this Company...you really are in very safe hands.  and To Jocelyn...Thank you and well done.Date of experience: May 02, 2023"

I bought a roll of tissue paper for wrapping packages, which is good quality, and a dispenser (also good quality).  My only less than positive comment is that the dispenser is useful for holding and unrolling the tissue paper, but the cutter is pretty useless.  It would be fine with a thicker paper but, with the tissue paper being thinner by nature, it rips if you try to use the cutter.  I am having to use scissors.

During that time we've rarely had any issues with our orders (occasional purchasing errors on our side that have always been resolved directly on the phone with their kind, curtious and knowledge support staff). Of late, I've been quietly impressed at how quickly our orders have been dispatched to our Warehouse in Cornwall - often arriving within 24hrs of an order being placed (i.e. ordering late evening and an order arriving early next morning!).  Their pricing has been pretty competitive over the few years we've been supplied by them.  Because the service and customer portal has been so swift, I'd not even contemplate going elsewhere. 👍Date of experience: April 11, 2023"

I have used Kite packaging a number of times now and have always been impressed with their fast dispatch and delivery - most of my orders have arrived a day or 2 after ordering. As a small business myself it is nice to have the option to buy fewer units but for an affordable price. I also appreciate the discount when buying more units, which I usually utilise when purchasing envelopes. Their eco-friendly range is brilliant, in particular the compostable mailers, and it allows me to match my packaging ethos with that of my products.Date of experience: March 14, 2023"

They arrived with tears in the packaging and the cardboard was damaged but still usable. I needed them asap so had no choice but to use. The courier (DX) left them in our neighbours garden and only brought them to us when I complained to Kite, and it was investigated by very helpful Daniel at Kite. The courier also faked a signature, and marked the item as delivered when both my partner and I were at home and she didn't even attempt to deliver. So not a great experience, Daniel is the reason you're getting 3 stars and not 1.Date of experience: March 14, 2023"

I sent photos and requested replacements to fulfil my order, but was told this was not possible as they are not able to ship the cartons without damage. I was refunded for the damaged cartons which I appreciate, however, this was not a good resolution for me as I had placed an order for the quantity or cartons I needed and I am now left with not enough cartons.Date of experience: February 17, 2023"

Roughly £60 worth.I also made a mistake and ordered the wrong size Jiffy bags and asked if I could have them exchanged for the next size up and thought they could, as an act of goodwill for my honesty, exchange them.Absolutely NOT was the answer. I could return them And reorder. Which meant I would have to pay the postage both ways. I understand why - but in all honesty, as I could have just kept the incorrectly sent goods, and not offered the information, I ‘thought’ they would’ve been a little more accommodating. HA HA NOAgent refused to refer to a manager or help other than offer to collect the incorrect items as ‘they were collecting their goods anyway’ I would still need to reorder - what a PIA this company is. I am beginning to give up the will to live with them TBH.Now, come get your stuff and stop emailing me about it as I will not spend another minute of my time trying to help you - just like you wouldn’t help me.Date of experience: March 06, 2023"

What is wrong with delivery couriers now. Could have left it with any of the other 6 companies next to us. Why have delivery instructions if they are not followed. This is the second time the driver just leaves goods outside without a signature and leaves. The goods are nice quality, but would consider not using Kite again now, because of the couriers they use.Date of experience: February 07, 2023"

Had some boxes that were glued a little wonky but not the end of the world.1 issue is with the Enviro boxes they come either plain, branded on the bottom or branded both top and bottom which is a little too much when using them as a business, what makes it worse is this changes on every order so you don't know what you'll get. Live chat couldn't tell me what each size of box would have so it's a lucky dip. 🤷‍♂️Date of experience: February 07, 2023"

The cardboard is peeling and much more flimsy, not as solid.

Chris Wakefield,2 reviews,5,GB,"Jan 11, 2023","Excellent Service from Great PeopleRE : Kara McCoy, Our account manager at Kite.Dear Kara,Many thanks for all your help this year with our pallet wrapping journey, your assistance has been invaluable and without it I wouldn’t have gotten very far confidently. As a result, of course, we ended up buying machinery and consumables for our warehouse so thank you very much for everything and have a Merry Christmas. I’d also like to add how refreshing it is to talk to a normal person instead of a programmed false sales representative – life is just easier when you deal real person to real person – a lesson I feel all those typical salespeople who attend all the brainwashing seminars could do with learning – personality goes a long way so don’t let the suits drive it out of you and turn you into a robot – though I know you, that will never happen! Lol. Managers should take note.Also, special shout out to Chris who came out pre-sale and after-sale. Again, a genuine person, knowledgeable and spent time with us that we greatly appreciate. Please send on a Christmas Thank You from us, exemplary service!So, that’s it, 2022 draws to a close and we all deserve a nice Christmas break.Thanks for everything guys and girls, Merry Christmas!ChrisDate of experience: December 01, 2022"

Lianne H,1 review,4,GB,"Dec 2, 2022Verified","Great prices for my small business. Delivery so, so.I’ve placed several orders with Kite. Great prices for the packaging needed for my small business.I’ve taken a star off because the quality of the boxes can be a little hit and miss (although not enough to put me off buying, yet) and they also use a delivery company, which has caused issues on more than one occasion. Nearly, always have a few damaged and unusable boxes on the outside of the bundles, due to mishandling. Poor tracking that doesn’t update, my latest delivery was showing as “out for delivery” for 3 days before it showed up and the one before nearly got sent back to Kite because DX said they had attempted to deliver 3 times, but I only had 1 “missed you” note and 1 delivery attempt showing on tracking. DX are near impossible to get hold of, live chat often unavailable during normal working hours and some of the advertised phone numbers have dead tones. Not directly Kites fault, but as with all businesses who offer delivery, it is their responsibility to use efficient delivery companies.Date of experience: November 24, 2022"

Barnaby,5 reviews,1,GB,"Nov 26, 2022","Unhelpful service!On Kite Packaging's website, their video ""Effective Closure of Boxes"" turns out to be a dead link. We've received 20 of their extra heavy duty boxes for a move, and as we're not people who pack every day, we have no idea how we are supposed to seal the box flaps. They seem too sturdy to fold under each other as one might with a weaker box. If we are to use tape, how do we apply the tape in the most effective way, and what sort of tape is the best?There is no instruction leaflet with the boxes.We would not mind the dead video link or the lack of instructions with our delivery if we could get customer service, but they only keep office hours Monday to Friday.You make helpful videos, but you need to make sure the links work!As you cannot make sure the links work, you need to either send an instruction leaflet with people's orders, or provide customer service outside normal office hours!If somebody from Kite can get back to me within the next few hours, I will remove this bad review.If somebody cannot get back to me and we end up making a mess of these heavy duty boxes, then we would appreciate free replacements once you can tell us how to close them!Date of experience: November 26, 2022"

Also, I detest the large kite wording and bar coding on the boxes! Kite customer care state is visible on website. I didn’t notice it.. The print and barcode is huge and makes the boxes ugly. I am trying to sell my own brand, not kites! When trying to make sure this is internal, the folds are the wrong way round.. scruffy and waste of my time. Cheap and nasty.. If using for your quality products avoid!Date of experience: November 07, 2022"

Goods despatched by Next day courier, but here is where things went south.  Only three of my four items arrived (irritatingly at 07:15 Hrs), all in a beaten-up tatty state.  The fourth item arrived the next day (again at 07:15 Hrs) this time looking like someone had played five-a-side soccer with the parcel.

The second will arrive on a random day, sometimes with DX, sometimes with a subcontracted courier.  The third part of the delivery (you will need to chase) will go missing and be identified as lost.

katrina,2 reviews,1,GB,"Updated Oct 21, 2022","I would not recommendI would not recommend, I bought an air cushion machine, they are not cheap. It was faulty within a few months. They said I needed to pay to get it sent to them for their engineer to look into it. I need it for my business so asked for a temp machine which they did give me for a cost. That also arrived faulty. I shipped my machine in the box that they provided me with the temp machine in. They got my machine & accused me of being careless & the roll holder apparently snapped off even though I took the roll holder off myself & placed it carefully in the temp box that they gave me, the exact same way they shipped the temp machine!!! Trying to charge me for that & for the fix even though they claim the machine has 1 year warranty which clearly is not true. When I stated that I took the roll holder off they quickly changed their story & said it broke in a different way & it somehow didn't snap off?? Clearly lying to get money off of me, crazy that a company would do this to a small family business, especially during these times. Disgusting behaviour & will NOT recommend to anyone, PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS & DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!!Update: they have stated the repair needed for my machine isn't under warranty so will need to be paid for, they also stated the following: a cost may be incurred and these will be advised before any work is carried out, they advised me of the costs & I did not consent to them going ahead. They have now gone ahead without my consent & now are not giving me back my deposit for the temp machine because I am refusing to pay as I did not give consent in the first place! Surely this is illegal?!Date of experience: October 20, 2022"

The product samples were dirty inside the envelope and incorrectly packaged by you leading to them being damaged. From my first contact your customer service rep on chat was rude and unhelful, telling me I was only allowed 3 samples and if that didn't suit I'd have to buy a full pack!

According to the temple staff the driver just got the delivery off his vehicle insisted the instructions were for it to be left there like it or not, when told it was not for them and pointed to our delivery entrance he ignored them and then just drove off.The lack of curtesy shown to the Temple staff was appalling.What is worse is to get to the temple he has had to drive passed our reception (with a big Safety Mundo sign in the window) and passed our goods in entrance if that is not incompetence I do not know what is. The impression I was given by the Temple staff is that the driver was quite rude and some what belligerent none of which is acceptable behavior.As a company we receive deliveries on a daily basis from a variety of carriers and have never had this happen before.After this I experience would serious have to look at other options before ordering from you again.Date of experience: October 13, 2022"

Horrific customer service!Kite packaging has displayed to a tee, everything that is wrong with business today that clearly forget who provides their profits..A simple issue that could have been resolved in a heartbeat turned into a lengthy diatribe and a clear case of the customer is WRONG! The inability to simply say, Hold on sir, I can rectify that for you and ship your order without the items not in stock, instead turns into me spending an extra £20 to get my boxes here on next day!! i""m livid with this company and after this order will be looking to take my business elsewhere..

Darren Jones,1 review,1,GB,"Updated Sep 20, 2022Verified","Spec changed to inferior quality - Awful Customer ServiceHave used Kite for the last few years as a sole supplier of shipping materials in order to provide continuity of a consistent quality - I bought amongst other items a box of large letter premium cardboard fluted mailers to top up stock in August and 5 weeks later opened them to find a vastly inferior product weighing 61g vs 77g per mailer. Contacted customer service and was fobbed off with an excuse that they had changed supplier. As I had opened them and had to use a couple to fulfill an order and the return time had expired there was nothing they can do - do they really expect repeat customers to check the quality of repeat orders supplied on delivery? Fortuneately there is something I can do - find a different supplier and pass there details on to the businesses that I have recommended Kite to in the past.Regarding Kite's reply there has been no contact with me apart from my initial contact and no resolution of the issueDate of experience: September 20, 2022"

Although they did kind of try once after numerous complaints about poor packaging.General lack of protective wrapping given in the packaging department resulting in damaged goods every time.The only remedy they offer is a free replacement of damaged goods, however they obviously run the gauntlet like the original order.I will continue to purchase whilst my patience allows me.Date of experience: September 04, 2022"

The returns procedure with Kite Packaging is the worst I've experienced. Kite Packaging do not have a convenient returns process in place if you order the wrong item.  In this instance and even as a credit account customer I simply want to exchange an order which cannot be done and you are left to outsource your own courier company to return anything.I buy dental supplies and materials regularly from various size companies and I've never experienced this with any of these companies. Goods are collected or a drop off courier/labelling procedure is in place.In summary it's just simply frustrating and inconvenient and if I could rate this less that 1 star I would.Date of experience: August 16, 2022"

We had issues once before several years ago, when what was supposed to a order of Jiffy bubble wrap was delivered, it might have been put into Jiffy bags but it was NOT Jiffy, the rolls were between a quarter and a third less fat, easily apparent as we sill had a couple of rolls of Jiffy left and the bubble wrap was the same poor quality as the last delivery. The first time a few years ago left me angry, but I gave Kite another chance, I do not intend to this time as this poor quality bubble wrap is making us late getting out several deliveries of art glass, we do not spend hours making glass sculptures just for them to end up broken, so in future it will be UKPackaging getting the orders.Date of experience: August 13, 2022"

Claire Wise,2 reviews,3,GB,"Jul 25, 2022Verified","Not suitable as moving boxesI can't fault the speed with which the boxes arrived, very quick and prompt delivery with protective packaging so none were damaged in transit, they arrived flat packed as described.However, given that in the product description ""these boxes provide high-quality protection that is more than sturdy enough to support many of our customers’ needs"" we were expecting boxes sturdy enough to move house with.  They are far from that, I'm not entirely sure what we are going to do with them, but in the way we have attempted to pack with them so far they are not fit for the reason we purchased them.  Lesson learned is all I can say to this, if the price looks too good that may be the case - I would recommend some labelling be applied to advise the typical weight the box can hold with standard tape.Date of experience: July 25, 2022"

Covered in a black oily dust, with plastic wrappings torn on boxes, the edges of the flat packed boxes bashed and misshapen and long tears in the bags of loose fill.  We have a retail business and therefore staff are dressed smartly, it's got to the stage that no one wants to handle the products when they arrive or put them in the stock room as they mark clothing and the areas / walls where they're stored.  Such a shame as the products are not bad quality - but the wrappings make them look like they've been down a coal mine.

Prices were good and delivery fast however all were sent individually in quantities of 100. Instead of receiving one box with all the items in I was sent over 20 individual boxes. All of which displayed the contents.For a company that sells packing supplies 1 box for a £150 order surely isn't too much to ask. Probably won't order againDate of experience: July 04, 2022"
Mark Stringer,2 reviews,3,GB,"Jul 4, 2022Verified","Damaged on arrival and delivered to the wrong propertyUnfortunately, the bags (no padding) wrapping my moving boxes were ripped in multiple places and some of the boxes were damaged - a few boxes even had small holes in the ones nearest the bags. They're still usable, but I would have hoped for a better from a company specialising in packaging materials. Aside from that, the price was good and they arrived quickly. However, they were also delivered to the wrong property (an office, when the address is clearly a house), and they weren't light or convenient to carry to my house.Date of experience: July 04, 2022"

We phoned them, again the same story, the woman who is on the phone trying to make that it is our fault instead saying sorry and be honest, we are very agree so connects with a gentlemen who knows how customer service works, apologies many times and ""arrange next day delivery with another company"", but I think they only sent our order after 4 days when we called.The boxes are ok, but the customer service and delivery company they use is really bad!Date of experience: July 03, 2022"

I paid £20 for the next-day delivery, but the boxes were not delivered. The following day, the driver left the boxes outside in the rain and signed my name as delivered. A replacement order was set again for a next-day delivery which again did not happen. This was then escalated to a Saturday delivery. On Saturday, I took a taxi to my warehouse to receive parcels at the agreed 9:30 am, only to be told that the parcel would not be delivered because there were no drivers available. I still have not received the order. When I asked for compensation, they said that the £20 ""CREDIT"" for the express delivery was not going to charged to my account—an extremely frustrating experience.

Previously the company threw my 4 parcels over my garden fence when it was raining and so the cardboard boxes were soggy and i had to throw some of my bags away as it is food packaging. And this time i asked for the boxes to be left behind the back gate which was left unlocked and they instead left 6 boxes stacked at the front door in full view of the street. Luckily i came home early as id left something at home or these would been sat in full street view for 6 hours and could easily have been taken!

They turned up next day which was brilliant, but rather than 40 packs as ordered, it was a pallet of 2000 individual boxes. Not what we were expecting or ordered. Have double checked their website, cannot see any mention that this was how they'd be delivered. As a home based ecommerce business without a pallet truck etc, it's a handling and storage nightmare. Moving, stacking and storing 40 individual packs would've taken minutes, whereas handling the 2000 sheets took many hours and are at far greater risk of being damaged etc. I spoke to customer service, and whilst they were very apologetic and understanding that doesn't really help us. Prior to ordering you might want to check how the goods will be delivered, if it matters to you. For the previous order of 20 packs we received 20 individually wrapped packs which was absolutely fine.Date of experience: June 20, 2022"

When I placed a large order 3000 black paddded bubble envelopes I asked if it was all in stock and was told yes. I opted for next day delivery which I paid for but my items did not arrive. I am a business customer and was informed by my warehouse supervisor that after 4 days the item still had not arrived. When I contacted Kite I was told the items were out of stock!!!! And that they were not expecting a delivery to them for at least 10 days!!! Now why was I told they were in stock at the time of placing an order?. I would of thought that out of common courtesy a phone call or an email to let me know was not too much to ask. This delayed our business from sending out 2000 items to customers as a business we cannot accept this. Whatever happened to customer service. Not a happy business customer at all!!!!!!Thnaks for the reply but this was not the case!!! My order 1994598 i received an enail an hour later on 27/5/22 confirming my order and that it will shortly be despatched it did NOT state that the items were out of stock.Date of experience: June 20, 2022"

Sophia Harding,3 reviews,2,GB,"Jun 6, 2022","Use the worst delivery company - Issues every single order.Have used them for years but the recent service over the last 6 months has become infuriating. I have received only 1 issue-free order in my last ten I'd say. There was a run of missing items which I was advised was due to new staff in the Kite warehouse. They did rectify these orders. The biggest issue however is their USELESS delivery couriers. I have issues with nearly every order - either they say delivered and it's still on the van, they miss half the order (leaving it on their van), or deliver it to another random address - this is the most common one. When you wait in all day for delivery just to find that it's gone who knows where, every time, it's incredibly annoying. With an order a few months back the driver told me he didn't have my packing peanuts but half my order. I wasn't having it so I walked down the road with him to the van and he miraculously found them (he had about 10 bags on there so clearly just couldn't be bothered to walk them around the corner to the door). Kite do always work to rectify the solution again, but of course this means another day stuck waiting for the order to be delivered. After a good few years of relying on them for my business postage, with many complaints about the delivery company, if they can't change this, I'll need to move over to another packaging supplier unfortunately.Date of experience: June 06, 2022"

I placed my order and it arrived quickly but unfortunately this is where the positive experience ends. I arrived to find my packages sat out in the rain despite a large and very polite note on the door requesting any packages be left in our shed (with an arrow). I also noted that both packages arrived with tears in them which meant there was damage to some items... Finally, they are not the best quality in my opinion.Upon contact I was asked how many items were damaged (maybe 7/8) and was offered a refund for those. I have replied to say that since delivery was not in any way, shape, or form successful that I would like the delivery charge refunded also. I do not think I am being unreasonable.I have replied/followed up 3 times and have received absolutely nothing back.I'm incredibly disappointed in both the delivery service and customer service I have received from this company and would not use them again.Date of experience: May 27, 2022"

Reviewed well known online shopping site, but also independent sites of packaging companies that clearly had a focus on bulk supply to business, but also offered products suitable for my purposes in terms of box size, number, type.Made price comparisons that included VAT and delivery charges. NOTE: the products compared were not direct equivalents, as different sizes of box were available in different quantities from different companies. Calculated the price per cubic metre for the purposes of comparison.Kite were 20% cheaper than the best price on the well known shopping site, and 18% cheaper than the next best of 8 other packaging companies.Web site was easy to navigate, product range was great, delivery timely, product quality excellent.Date of experience: April 19, 2022"

VH,1 review,3,GB,"Apr 11, 2022Verified","Good product changed into a bad oneA couple of months ago I ordered 50 book mailers and they were excellent quality so recently I went ahead and ordered another 100 - same product code and description. Except this new batch is terrible quality, nothing like the first one. The cardboard is thinner, more flimsy, and the fold perforations are done so badly that every time you try to make a fold the whole thing breaks rather than folds. Disappointing. Had I received this product with my first order, I never would have made the second order. Once I run out of these 100, I will likely look elsewhere for a similar product. A shame, as the company is good to work with - I have ordered other products from them before and they have always been good quality and the shipping and customer service are great. Too bad they have compromised the quality of what was a good product to start with for a rather substandard version of the same, while keeping the same name/product code.Date of experience: April 11, 2022"

It insisted that before my first order, its quality had been same from same provider. But my first order was in the July, 2021 and order no 1689142. Kitepackaging’s excuse can lead the customers to think I am wrong. My statement is true.

The reason for 4 stars is that I spent a lot of time trying to find truly eco-friendly packaging for wrapping up home contents, having run out of stuff I'd saved. So I ordered recycled paper 'bubble wrap', recycled tissue and paper tape. However, the packaging arrived swathed in plastic wrapping and tape, which I found sadly amusing. I'm not sure what this is made from - some information would have been helpful. I think it might be the flexible plastic that can be recycled in some stores (like bread bags etc) so I've hopefully put it with that. The brown plastic tape (of which there was not a lot, to be fair), I had to throw away.Date of experience: April 01, 2022"

Vince Legentil,2 reviews,1,GB,"Mar 27, 2022","A packaging company that can't package their packaging...I order a considerable amount of packaging a year for my business and I've always had issues with the quality from Kite Packaging. Because they use the cheapest packaging to package their packaging, it becomes damaged and unusable when it gey delivered. I have mentioned this to the company many times and nothing is done to avoid any further damage to my orders.I would expect a packaging company to be able to utilise the correct packaging so that orders are arriving in good condition.Double corrugated cardboard will get delivered so damaged that it becomes a single layer of flattened cardboard which then would offer less protection.It's a shame as the company offer great prices but this sadly comes at a greater cost. I waste so much time going through each delivery and contacting the company that it would be cheaper to go for another company.Date of experience: March 27, 2022"

Karen,1 review,1,GB,"Mar 20, 2022Verified","Poor quality. Poor customer serviceOrdered large boxes from Kite after being happy with them on my previous order. This order I received was NOT the same boxes. They were so flimsy. Squashed when you picked them up. Not suitable for the size the box was, they could not take any weight at all. Complained to Kite who ‘investigated’ and said they were the same boxes which is rubbish. I even sent them side by side pictures with the different product codes to show they weren’t the same. They refused to accept my complaint. But who cares, got a refund via PayPal after they refused! I would have returned these to them but now I don’t have to so ultimately they lost out by having such crap customer service.Date of experience: March 20, 2022"

I am also finding it very hard to get the boxes to stay together when I attempt to fit them into the grooves in order to structure them. It’s like they aren’t long enough so do not hold. I have to use extra tape to hold them into place which is a big inconvenience as this is the main reason I choose this type of packaging so I don’t need to use as much tape to keep them together.Is there anything that can be done about this or for future purchases?Date of experience: March 09, 2022"

What an amazing website that you can buy essentials in bulk for a reasonably affordable price! There are a variety of different items with many l selections within each category. I also had to cancel and redo an order as I missed an item and the customer service rep was very helpful over the phone and attended to my request efficiently!Delivery was also very fast and I received my order within 3days of ordering. You aren’t able to track the specific whereabouts of your DX courier but the few updates and very fast delivery makes up for that. In conclusion I highly recommend this company as for my first order I was not disappointed at all and will definitely continue choosing them to order my packaging from.Thank you for such amazing service kite delivery.

Richard Cullip,9 reviews,2,GB,"Mar 3, 2022Verified","Not very good service.I ordered five rolls of 750mm wide Kraft paper; i received five rolls of 600mm width. Before they would replace them I had to send them a photograph of the rolls, against a tape, to prove that they were the wrong size. I can understand this might be necessary for damaged items but not for incorrectly supplied items which were to be collected when the correct ones were delivered. When I received the correct rolls they had been very poorly wrapped in a single layer of thin plastic sheet which had, unsurprisingly, been severely torn in transit which resulted in the outer layers of the rolls being damaged and, therefore, wasted.Date of experience: March 03, 2022"

Gerry,7 reviews,1,GB,"Feb 24, 2022Verified","Third successive order where I have not…Third successive order where I have not received it in one delivery. I keep being told it’s not your fault , and that blame lies with your courier. Why?  I don’t order from your courier. I order from you. I care not one not jot about your courier partner arrangement, other than the fact that it clearly is failing your customers.  Unless every single page on your website carries an impossible not to see disclaimer, stating clearly that you are not interested in what happens to your customers’ product once you’ve dispatched it, why would I be?  This time ( I ordered on the 14th , it’s now the 25th) I still haven’t received my full order. Your refusal to take this seriously has lost me as a customer. NO MORE SHIFTING BLAME. I ask if I can take this further than simply customer services so that an MD might hear my complaint but I’m not even offered that possibility. You have repeatedly assured me you don’t “part ship” but my most recent call to customer services resulted in an admission that part of my order hadn’t even left the warehouse. At what point would that have been noticed if I hadn’t called to complain…again?!  It HAD been shipped incomplete even though the product was in stock. An assurance was given that the remainder of my order would be sent out “express” . I still haven’t received my full order. Why not? Your trading / business arrangement with your courier needs ripping up and reinventing. I am tired of hearing that none of this is your fault. It’s nobody else’s.  I am more angry at the constant and standard approach of passing the blame than anything else. You used to be a wonderful company to do business with, with fantastic customer service. You simply are not any longer.Date of experience: February 24, 2022"

tofu. ldn,2 reviews,2,GB,"Feb 21, 2022","My first order arrived when it had…My first order arrived when it had estimated however, there was an item missing/ lost in transit. Fair enough, these things happen and I called immediately to rearrange the order or replace. The lady I spoke to was very direct and slightly rude, she told me it was not possible to change the item as it was already in transit for the next day. I asked for a refund instead and she said this was only possible when the item had arrived which was strange and that I would have to pay a further shipment fee to return when the item arrives which is very odd. Anyway, the item never arrived in the end, so after two days I then had to call back to see what was going on. The item was lost. Great, seeing as there’s no longer any transit it would be illogical for them not to be able to change over my order and send it back to me. But no, I would now only be able to receive a refund or receive the incorrect item again.. paying a second shipping fee for the correct item.. it would now cost me £12 in total to ship a few boxes and some little poly bags from warehouse which is 5mins away from where I’m based.Date of experience: February 21, 2022"

I think Kite needs to take more care when protecting the items during transport (ie use protective corners or any other types of protection that prevents bending, corner bending and water getting to the cardboard boxes). The products are good price though. Hopefully this is good feedback, it is a pity that this happened during transport.Date of experience: February 20, 2022"

NH,2 reviews,3,GB,"Feb 13, 2022Verified","White A5 all board envelopes design changeOrdered some A5 white, all board cardboard envelopes which I've ordered before and really liked - they were really sturdy and secure. However, this time, the design of the envelope has changed making the flap that seals the envelope a different shape. When the envelope is supposed to be sealed, there are now gaps between the flap and the main body of the envelope which make the package a lot less secure - my worry is that it would be easy for damage to happen to the envelope in the postal system as things could get caught in the gap and cause the envelope to rip. Really disappointed with these now - and I'm adding extra tape to secure the envelope and cover the gaps before posting because I send out custom made items and don't want them to arrive damaged. Definitely one of those situations when you wonder why change something that already works - and I won't be purchasing them again.Date of experience: February 13, 2022"

Philip,3 reviews,5,GB,"Feb 12, 2022Verified","A good experienceA friend recommended Kite boxes for some heavy parcels I had to send. The process of ordering and receiving the boxes was very good. The website was clear regarding box sizes, and the order was delivered in 24 hours. The double-walled boxes were strong, and had two 'fold-lines' that could be used to make the boxes smaller without any difficulty, which I thought was a good idea. The price was much better than 'high street' shops and DIY chains.Date of experience: February 12, 2022"

Martin,11 reviews,4,GB,"Updated Feb 25, 2022Verified","A hole in the cardboard.The first couple of sheets had a hole through them approximately 1 inch by 1/2 an inch. The sides and corners were a bit squashed too. I'm assuming this was caused in transit as we bought cardboard before and it was okay. Personally I would not recommend the carriers they used, every parcel we have had delivered by DX in the last year has looked like it went through a war zone.UPDATE : Kite Packaging reached out to me after my review and refunded me for the damaged cardboard, which was very kind since it was more likely the carriers fault as I suggested in my review. I have updated my rating accordingly.Date of experience: February 11, 2022"

Bluey,4 reviews,1,GB,"Feb 2, 2022","IF I COULD GIVE THEM 0 I WOULD HAVEIF I COULD GIVE THEM 0 I WOULD HAVEKite Packaging has proved to be very incompetent and unprofessional from our first point of order till date. We placed our order and we were sent a product that we did not order. We when called them and informed them that were received a wrong package. This delayed our order for another two days and then we actually received our order it was wrong and to add to it it was only a part order which was very frustrating. This delayed or work for another week; all thanks to the unprofessional services of KITE PACKAGING. We then again informed them that the order was wrong and they confirmed they will send the correct order in the next days; which was again delay of 3 days.I finally got our order of the actual machinery; only to discover that they sent a faulty machine and they acknowledged the fact that it was faulty and they were sending the replacement part in the post. On inquiring with them how long it would take. They confirmed it would be another 5 to 7 days.I was quite annoyed but unfortunately the fact that i had to deal with this incompetency was over whelming. Due to the fact that i had ordered their machine ; i am now forced to buy their consumables and called up their customer services/ account handler to request my order to be processed correctly this time and if they can deal with this sooner as they have caused me nothing but a loss of time and money and a production delay.A customer service girl did say she will ask her manager and will get back to me if she can get this expedited.. only to be told that they did not care for my loss and the patience i have had with their company and that their only way was to send it to standard post which was another 7 days of delay and she could not even assure me that they would do it right this time. So now I AM LOST and do not understand how can companies be so unethical and inconsiderate to their customers. All i asked them was for an expedited delivery and to ensure they had got it right this time. I AM TOTALLY LOST FOR WORDS. I would definitely avoid them and go to other packing companies. I now have to wait and ponder if the part that they sent will fix the faulty machine they sent . They have taken my money and given me a faulty machinery which i have to fix for them. This is absolute rubbish.Date of experience: February 02, 2022"

Far to tightly bound they were buckled over i.e. not flat. The wrapping didn't give any protection to the edges which were bashed in and the outside sheets had scrapes in them! People purchase these for all manner of things  not just for internal packaging where marks and scrapes don't matter as much. I required them for a craft project. Overall not great due to the parceling of them.Date of experience: January 21, 2022"

This time opted for refund, agreed to collect the item delivered as it was of no use to me without the missing item. Agreed a collection date however failed to collect along with a further two occasions. Courier did turn up on a date that wasn’t agreed however no one in. Promised a refund however never received. Total joke of a company, had to raise a claim on my credit card.  On a second note the box’s I did receive were of extremely poor quality. USE AT YOUR PERILDate of experience: January 16, 2022"
